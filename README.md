# Frontend Mentor - Dictionary web app

![Design preview for the Dictionary web app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my entry for the [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) dictionary app challenge. 


Users are able to do the following: 

âœ… Search for words using the input field

âœ… See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word

âœ… See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form

âœ… Play the audio file for a word when it's available

âœ… Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts

âœ… Switch between light and dark themes

âœ… View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

âœ… See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

âœ…  **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for users based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.
